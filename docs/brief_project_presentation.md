# About this project

SamGIS is an attempt to perform instance segmentation on geospatial data even without the use of dedicated graphics cards.
The user interact on a leaflet webmap choosing areas to recognize and a backend responds with a geojson containing one or more 
recognized polygons within the initial webmap.
